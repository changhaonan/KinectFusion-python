# kf_pycuda
A basic implementation of KinectFusion \[1\] with PyCuda inspired by https://github.com/andyzeng/tsdf-fusion-python. Many details of KinectFusion are ignored for simplicity.

A sample video dataset could be found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y9fbiYRgV-GqERCK7OcuQDUFubAmfI-L/view?usp=sharing

Change the path in kinect_fusion.py before you run the script. If you run on your own dataset, you need to change config.py as well.
